# Fall Detection using YOLO and Machine Learning

This project is a fall detection system that uses the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm and machine learning techniques to detect whether a person has fallen or not.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run this project:
OpenCV
NumPy
scikit-learn
Keras
TensorFlow
You can install these libraries using pip:

## Command to install required libraries
```
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn keras tensorflow
```
## Usage
To use this fall detection system, run the following command:
```
python detect_fall.py --video <path-to-video>

```
This will detect falls in the specified video and output the results to the console.
